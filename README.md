# Soccer Stats API
 
PURPOSE OF THIS API To track statistics of teams and players in La Liga for the 2023 season and find out information about each table!

(Only TEAM is functioning): Was having a tough tough time just getting this to work because of Mac errors.
GET list of teams: api/team
GET certain team by Team number api/team/(teamno)
PUT any attribute changes to a specific team /api/team/(teamno)
POST a new team to the table api/team


If I were to have finished this API Project's player aspect, it would've returned details about specified players and their stats in the 2023 season of La Liga. Adding to that perhaps I could add support for coach statistics or how teams from different leagues square off in the UCL.

WRAPPING THOUGHTS Through this project I learned a lot about SQL, C#, Postman and APIs in general, all of which I had no knowledge of before this class. Though a few concepts were slightly difficult, the class was very informative and a great learning experience overall.
