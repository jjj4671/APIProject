IMPORTANT To view the readme with proper spacing, please click on it in the code and then read it through the source blob option or raw.

REQUIREMENTS Everything seems to be fine on the code end however I am getting a recurring fatal error on my Mac when running the api for a login on my keychain that doesn't exist! I do not have another pc unfortunately and I'm unsure what to do about this : (

PURPOSE OF THIS API To track statistics of teams and players in La Liga for the 2023 season and find out information about each table!

Get for player stats (overall)
Get for player stats (individual)
Put for Player Stats
Delete for Player item
Get for Team Stats (list)
Get for Team Stats (individual)
Delete for Team.

If I were to have finished this API Project and been able to test it and see it working, it would've returned details about specified players or teams and their stats in the 2023 season of La Liga.

WRAPPING THOUGHTS Through this project I learned a lot about SQL, C#, Postman and APIs in general, all of which I had no knowledge of before this class. Though a few concepts were slightly difficult, the class was very informative and a great learning experience overall.
